            <p class="card-text">"We had a great experience working with Cavalucci Construction to transform the exterior of our dated French Tudor home. Ralph and his team were punctual, professional, and easy to work with. We were so happy with the workmanship that when it was time to remodel the interior of our home, we didn’t hesitate to call Ralph. Despite all the craziness brought about by the pandemic, Ralph and his team stayed on course and completed our 3 bath/2 laundry room renovation in a timely fashion and on budget! We highly recommend Cavalucci Construction.</p>

            <p class="card-text">"We have used Cavalucci Construction for three projects of varying complexity in the past five years.  The fact that we are repeat customers should tell you that we have been highly satisfied, and here are some details. Ralph is present at the job site nearly every day to ensure that the work is proceeding according to plan. When multiple subcontractors were involved, he coordinated their schedules so that there was never an unnecessary pause in construction.  He has worked with his subcontractors for many years, so he (and we) know that they are trustworthy and perform top quality work.  Ralph is not satisfied unless we are fully satisfied.  When the job is completed, the crew leaves the work area clean and tidy.</p>

            <p class="card-text">"We couldn't be happier with the full bathroom renovation completed by our general contractor, Ralph Cavalucci. From start to finish, the experience was excellent. He provided invaluable connections to reliable vendors, making the process of selecting tile, plumbing fixtures, and our glass shower door remarkably smooth. His on-site team was consistently efficient, neat, clean, and polite, showing great respect for our home. Whenever a design question arose, his expert advice was truly appreciated, guiding our choices while always considering the practicalities of the space. The final outcome has exceeded our expectations, leaving us with a truly stunning and functional new bathroom.</p>
